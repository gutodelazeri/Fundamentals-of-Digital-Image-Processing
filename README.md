# Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing

This is a collection of activities that I made in the context of INF01046, a digital image processing course offered at UFRGS. I took the course in 2019 and it was given by professor [Manuel Menezes de Oliveira Neto](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/). An overview of each activitie is given below.

### Projects
A compilation of three programs that implement several digital image processing concepts, like contrast variation, brightness variation, grayscale conversion, histogram calculation, quantization of grayscale images, horizontal and vertical mirroring, rotation, convolution, filtering in the Frequency Domain, etc. All the programs have a graphical interface.
   
### Hybrid Images
Final project of the course. It consists in the implementation of a a technic to create hybrid images that is described in [this article](https://github.com/gutodelazeri/Fundamentals-of-Digital-Image-Processing/blob/master/Hybrid-Images/docs/Article.pdf).
