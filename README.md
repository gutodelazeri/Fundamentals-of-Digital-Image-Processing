# Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing

### Projects
Each project is a program that implements several digital image processing concepts, such as contrast variation, brightness variation, grayscale conversion, histogram calculation, quantization of grayscale images, horizontal and vertical mirroring, rotation, convolution, filtering in the Frequency Domain, etc. All the programs have a graphical interface.
   
### Hybrid Images
Implementation of a technique for creating hybrid images, as described in [this article](https://github.com/gutodelazeri/Fundamentals-of-Digital-Image-Processing/blob/master/Hybrid-Images/docs/Article.pdf).
