# Usage

Inside the directory named src:  
> $ python3 main.py baseImage alternativeImage highpass lowpass  

* baseImage: name of the image to be seen from close
* alternativeImage: name of the image to be seen from close
* highpass: cutoff frequency of the highpass filter
* lowpass: cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter  

Remember to specify the name of the images WITH the extension. Also, remember
that the program can only find images inside the directory named BaseImages.  
The output of the execution can be found in the directory named results. A
